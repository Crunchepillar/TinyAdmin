This mod uses BepinEx to modify the game code, like most Unity mods.
The release page for Bepin can be found here:
    https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases

Installing Bepin 5:
    Download and install version 5 to the same folder where you can see the game
    (Lethal Company.exe) If you don't know where that is right click on the game
    in steam, then "manage" then "browse local files" drag the files from the bepin
    zip right into this folder, all of the files. Run the game once and bepin will
    automatically run its first time setup (this will require no input from you).
    Once you're at the main menu, quit the game. Inside the BepinEx folder there
    will now be two folders you need to know about. "Plugins" and "Config".

Installing the Mod:
    Place this mod inside the plugins folder. It should look like 
    "Plugins/Flowerful/TinyAdmin.dll" and run the game again.
